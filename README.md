# Intro

This is a simple HTML button that allows readers to copy and share the article they're reading.

## Customization

This button comes with preset UTM values that will populate into Google Analytics, but you can change them to match your site's style by simply changing the values in the code. You can also change the button text or color.

### Deploy

This is a very simple component, built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's fully contained, so deployment is easy: Copy the button.html code and paste it into a global region that shows at the bottom of article pages.

You may need to adjust the presentation of the button depending on your site's existing CSS styles.
